## Installation

If you're running Jekyll v3.5+ and self-hosting you can quickly install the theme as a Ruby gem. If you're hosting with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) you can install as a [remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) or directly copy all of the theme files (see [structure](#structure) below) into your project.

### Ruby Gem Method

1. Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile` (or [create one](example/Gemfile)):

   ```ruby
   gem "jekyll-theme-so-simple"
   ```

2. Add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   theme: jekyll-theme-so-simple
   ```

3. Then run [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to install the theme gem and dependencies:

   ```terminal

## Installation

If you're running Jekyll v3.5+ and self-hosting you can quickly install the theme as a Ruby gem. If you're hosting with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) you can install as a [remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) or directly copy all of the theme files (see [structure](#structure) below) into your project.

### Ruby Gem Method

1. Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile` (or [create one](example/Gemfile)):

   ```ruby
   gem "jekyll-theme-so-simple"
   ```

2. Add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   theme: jekyll-theme-so-simple
   ```

3. Then run [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to install the theme gem and dependencies:

   ```terminal
   bundle install
   ```

### GitHub Pages Method

GitHub Pages has added [full support](https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages) for any GitHub-hosted theme.

1. Replace `gem "jekyll"` with:

   ```ruby
   gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
   ```

2. Run `bundle update` and verify that all gems install properly.

3. Add `remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"` to your
   `_config.yml` file. Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` entries.

---

**Note:** Your Jekyll site should be viewable immediately at <http://USERNAME.github.io>. If it's not, you can force a rebuild by pushing empty commits to GitHub (see below for more details).

If you're hosting several Jekyll based sites under the same GitHub username you will have to use Project Pages instead of User Pages. Essentially you rename the repo to something other than **USERNAME.github.io** and create a `gh-pages` branch off of `master`. For more details on how this works, check [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

#### Remove the Unnecessary

If you forked or downloaded the [`so-simple-theme` repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) you can safely remove the following files and folders:

* `.github`
* `docs`
* `example`
* `.editorconfig`
* `.gitattributes`
* `banner.js`
* `CHANGELOG.md`
* `Gemfile`
* `jekyll-theme-so-simple.gemspec`
* `package.json`
* `Rakefile`
* `README.md`
* `README-OLD.md`
* `screenshot.png`

## Upgrading

If you're using the Ruby Gem or remote theme versions of So Simple, upgrading is fairly painless.

To check which version you are currently using, view the source of your built site and you should something similar to:

```
<!--
    So Simple Jekyll Theme 3.0.0
    Copyright 2013-2018 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes
    Free for personal and commercial use under the MIT license
    https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/LICENSE
-->
```

This will be at the top of every `.html` file, `/assets/css/main.css`, and `/assets/js/main.js`.

### Ruby Gem

Simply run `bundle update` if you're using Bundler (have a `Gemfile`) or `gem update jekyll-theme-so-simple` if you're not.

### Remote Theme

Verify you have the [latest version](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/releases) assigned in `_config.yml`

```
remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"
```

Note: If `@x.x.x` is omitted the theme's current `master` branch will be used. It is advised to ["lock" `remote_theme`](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme#declaring-your-theme) at a specific version to avoid introducing breaking changes to your site.

The next step requires rebuilding your [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site so it can pull down the latest theme updates. This can be achieved by pushing up a commit to your GitHub repo.

An empty commit will get the job done too if you don't have anything to push at the moment:

```terminal
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force rebuild of site"
```

### Use Git

If you want to get the most out of the Jekyll + GitHub Pages workflow, then you'll need to utilize Git. To pull down theme updates manually you must first ensure there's an upstream remote. If you forked the theme's repo then you're likely good to go.

To double check, run `git remote -v` and verify that you can fetch from `origin https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme.git`.

To add it you can do the following:

```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme.git
```

#### Pull Down Updates

Now you can pull any commits made to theme's `master` branch with:

```terminal
git pull upstream master
```

Depending on the amount of customizations you've made after forking, there's likely to be merge conflicts. Work through any conflicting files Git flags, staging the changes you wish to keep, and then commit them.

### Update Files Manually

Another way of dealing with updates is [downloading the theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/archive/master.zip) --- replacing your layouts, includes, and assets with the newer ones manually. To be sure that you don't miss any changes review the theme's [commit history](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/commits/master) to see what has changed.

Here's a quick checklist of the important folders/files you'll want to be mindful of:

| Name                   |                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `_layouts`             | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any layouts.                        |
| `_includes`            | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any includes.                       |
| `assets`               | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized stylesheets or scripts.             |
| `_sass`                | Replace all. Apply edits if you customized Sass partials.                      |
| `_data/navigation.yml` | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. |
| `_data/text.yml`       | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. |
| `_config.yml`          | Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions. |

---

**Note:** If you're not seeing the latest version, be sure to flush browser and CDN caches. Depending on your hosting environment older versions of `/assets/css/main.css`, `/assets/js/main.min.js`, or `*.html` files may be cached.

## Structure

Layouts, includes, Sass partials, and data files are all placed in their default locations. Stylesheets and scripts can be found in `assets`, and a few development related files in the project's root directory.

**Please note:** If you installed So Simple via the Ruby Gem or remote theme methods, theme files found in `/_layouts`, `/_includes`, `/_sass`, and `/assets` will be missing from your project. This is normal as they are bundled with the [`jekyll-theme-so-simple`](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-so-simple) gem.

```
├── _data               # data files
|  ├── navigation.yml   # navigation bar links
|  └── text.yml         # theme text
├── _includes           # theme includes
├── _layouts            # theme layouts (see below for usage)
├── _sass               # Sass partials
├── assets
|  ├── css
|  |  └── main.scss
|  └── js
|     └── main.min.js
├── _config.yml         # sample configuration
└── index.md            # sample home page (recent posts/not paginated)
```

### Starting Fresh

After creating a `Gemfile` and installing the theme you'll need to add and edit the following files:

* [`_config.yml`](_config.yml)
* [`/_data/navigation.yml`](_data/navigation.yml)
* [`/_data/text.yml`](_data/text.yml)
* [`index.md`](index.md)

**Note:** Consult the [**pagination**](#pagination) documentation below for instructions on how to enable it on the home page.

### Starting from `jekyll new`

Using the `jekyll new` command will get you up and running the quickest.

Edit your `Gemfile` and `_config.yml` files following the [installation guide](#installation) above and [configuration guide](#configuring) below, then create `_data/text.yml` as instructed earlier.

## Configuring

Configuration of site-wide elements (`locale`, `title`, `description`, `url`, `logo`, `author`, etc.) happens in your project's `_config.yml`. See the [example configuration](example/_config.yml) in this repo for additional reference.

| Name          | Description                                                              | Example                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `locale`      | Primary language for the site.                                           | `"en-us"`                           |
| `title`       | Site's title.                                                            | `"My Awesome Site"`                 |
| `description` | A short description.                                                     | `"This is my site, it is awesome."` |
| `baseurl`     | Used to test the website under the same base url it will be deployed to. | `/my-base-path`                     |
| `url`         | The full URL to your site.                                               | `"https://your-site.com"`           |
| `logo`        | Path to a site-wide logo used in masthead.                                | `/images/your-logo.png`             |

### Site Skin

Three skins (default, light, and dark) are available to change the color palette of the theme.

| `default.css` | `light.css` | `dark.css` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![default skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/images/default-skin.png) | ![light skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/images/light-skin.png) | ![dark skin](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/images/dark-skin.png) |

```yaml
skin: "/assets/css/skins/default.css"
skin: "/assets/css/skins/light.css"
skin: "/assets/css/skins/dark.css"
```

To use a custom skin other than the ones provided:

1. Copy and rename [`/assets/css/skins/default.scss`](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/assets/css/skins/default.scss) to your local repo.
2. Override and customize Sass variables as you see fit.
3. Update the `skin` path in `_config.yml` to reference this new skin `.css` file.

### Site Locale

**`site.locale`** is used to declare the primary language for each web page within the site.

_Example:_ locale: `"en-US"` sets the lang attribute for the site to the United States flavor of English, while `en-GB` would be for the United Kingdom style of English. Country codes are optional and the shorter variation `locale: "en"` is also acceptable. To find your language and country codes check this [reference table](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx>).

Properly setting the locale is important for associating localized text found in the text data file.

**Note:** The theme defaults to text in English (`en`, `en-US`, `en-GB`). If you change locale in `_config.yml` to something else be sure to add the corresponding locale key and translated text to [`_data/text.yml`](_data/text.yml).

### Site URL

The base hostname and protocol for your site. If you're hosting with GitHub Pages this will be something like `url: "https://github.io.mmistakes"` or `url: "https://your-site.com"` if you have a custom domain name.

GitHub Pages now [forces `https://` for new sites](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/), so be mindful of that when setting your URL to avoid mixed-content warnings.

**Note:** Jekyll overrides the value of `url` with `http://localhost:4000` when running `jekyll serve` locally in development. If you want to avoid this behavior set `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to [force the environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#specifying-a-jekyll-environment-at-build-time) to production.

### Site Base URL

This option causes all kinds of confusion in the Jekyll community. If you're not hosting your site as a [GitHub Project Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) or in a subfolder (e.g., `/blog`), then don't mess with it.

In the case of the **So Simple** demo site it's hosted on GitHub at <https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme>. To correctly set this base path I'd use `url: "https://mmistakes.github.io"` and `baseurl: "/so-simple-theme"`.

For more information on how to properly use `site.url` and `site.baseurl` as intended by the Jekyll maintainers, check [Parker Moore's post on the subject](https://byparker.com/blog/2014/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/).

**Note:** When using `baseurl` remember to include it as part of your link and asset paths in your content. Values of `url:` and `baseurl: "/blog"` would make your local site visible at <http://localhost:4000/blog> and not <http://localhost:4000>. You can either prepend all your asset and internal link paths with `{{ site.baseurl }}` or use Jekyll's `relative_url`.

To use the example values above the following image path of `{{ '/images/my-image.jpg' | relative_url }}` would output correctly as `http://localhost:4000/blog/images/my-image.jpg`.

Without the `relative_url` filter that asset path would be missing `/blog` and you'd have a broken image on your page.


Enable [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org) (a JavaScript display engine for mathematics) site-wide with

``` yaml
mathjax:
  enable: true
```

The `combo` option lets you to choose a [MathJax component
combination](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/components/combined.html)--the
default is "tex-svg."  And, the `tags` option lets you control
equation numbering--choices are "ams" (default), "all", and "none."

Sample configuration:

``` yaml
mathjax:
  enable: true             # MathJax equations, e.g. true, false (default)
  combo: "tex-svg"         # "tex-svg" (default), "tex-mml-chtml", etc.
  tags: "ams"              # "none", "ams" (default), "all"
```

### Google Fonts

Easily use [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) throughout your site by replacing the font `name` and `weights` accordingly. Suggested font pairings are as follows:

```yaml
google_fonts:
  - name: "Source Sans Pro"
    weights: "400,400i,700,700i"
  - name: "Lora"
    weights: "400,400i,700,700i"
```

**Note:** If other font families are used, be sure to add, then override the following SCSS variables in `/assets/css/main.scss` with the `font-family` values Google provides.

```scss
$serif-font-family: "Lora", serif;
$sans-serif-font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif;
$monospace-font-family: Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, "Courier New", Courier,
  monospace;

$base-font-family: $sans-serif-font-family;
$headline-font-family: $sans-serif-font-family;
$title-font-family: $serif-font-family;
$description-font-family: $serif-font-family;
$meta-font-family: $serif-font-family;
```

See [stylesheet documentation](#customizing-sass-scss) below for more information on overriding the theme's default variables.

### Pagination

Break up the main listing of posts on the home page across multiple pages by [enabling pagination](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/).

1. Include the [`jekyll-paginate`][jekyll-paginate] plugin in your `Gemfile`.

   ```ruby
   group :jekyll_plugins do
     gem "jekyll-paginate"
   end
   ```

2. Add `jekyll-paginate` to the `plugins` array (previously `gems`) in your `_config.yml` file and the following pagination settings:

   ```yaml
   paginate: 10  # amount of posts to show per page
   paginate_path: /page:num/
   ```

3. Create `index.html` (or rename `index.md`) in the root of your project and add the following front matter:

   ```yaml
   layout: home
   paginate: true
   ```

### Search

To index the full content of your documents for use in a [search page](#layout-search), set `search_full_content` to `true` in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
search_full_content: true
```

**Note:** Large amounts of posts will increase the size of the search index, impacting page load performance. Setting `search_full_content` to `false` (the default) restricts indexing to the first 50 words of body content.

### Taxonomy Pages

By default, category and tags added to a post are not linked to taxonomy archive pages. To enable this behavior and link to pages with posts grouped by category or tag, add the following:

```yaml
category_archive_path: "/categories/#"
tag_archive_path: "/tags/#"
```

These paths should mimic the permalinks used for your [**categories**](#layout-categories) and [**tags archive**](#layout-tags) pages. The `#` at the end is necessary to target the correct taxonomy section on the pages.

For example if you were to create `categories.md` with the following front matter:

```yaml
title: Categories Archive
layout: categories
permalink: /foo/
```

You'd need to change `category_archive_path` to `"/foo/#` for category links to function properly.

**Note:** You can create dedicated category and tag pages manually with [`layout: category`](#layout-category) and [`layout: tag`](#layout-tag). Or use plugins like [**jekyll-archives**][jekyll-archives] or [**jekyll-paginate-v2**](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-AUTOPAGES.md) to generate them automatically.

### Comments (via Disqus)

If you have a [**Disqus**](https://disqus.com/) account, you can show a comments section below each post.

To enable Disqus comments, add your [Disqus shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208) to your project's `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
disqus:
  shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

Comments only appear in production when built with the following [environment value](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#specifying-a-jekyll-environment-at-build-time): `JEKYLL_ENV=production` to avoid polluting your Disqus account with `localhost` content.

If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's front matter.

### Google Analytics

To enable [**Google Analytics**](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), add your tracking ID to `_config.yml` like so:

```yaml
google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N
```

Similar to Disqus comments above, the Google Analytics tracking script will only appear in production when using the following environment value: `JEKYLL_ENV=production`.

### Other

For more configuration options be sure to consult the documentation for:
[**jekyll-seo-tag**][jekyll-seo-tag], [**jekyll-feed**][jekyll-feed],
[**jekyll-paginate**][jekyll-paginate], and [**jekyll-sitemap**][jekyll-sitemap].

## Layouts

This theme provides the following layouts, which you can use by setting the `layout` [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) on each page, like so:

```yaml
---
layout: name
---
```

### `layout: default`

This layout handles all of the basic page scaffolding placing the page content between the masthead and footer elements. All other layouts inherit this one and provide additional styling and features inside of the `{{ content }}` block.

### `layout: post`

This layout accommodates the following front matter:



[jekyll-seo-tag]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag
[jekyll-feed]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed
[jekyll-paginate]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate
[jekyll-sitemap]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap
[jekyll-archives]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives
